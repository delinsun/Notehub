* After saving your notes, notes will be shared to friends you selected, and they can fill in other note details in the software.In addition, every people using this web app can search stored notes since it is open-source. Friends in this software can take notes of a same file and also comment on other friends' notes.
* Our goal is to let different users taking notes and comments together with version control feature that enable users to access different versions of notes to maximize the learning efficiency.
* We might also add features  find people that you know or do not know who is reading the same/similar book/pdf file as you do. You can send friend request to them. If you do not want to see someone's notes, you can set to ignore his/her notes.
* One additional feature is to use image to text api from google or microsoft to analyze sentences (NLP) of notes to identify which version of notes is the best. We may think of and add on more features later.
